This project is aimed at developing analysis and visualization utilities for speed during cycling, based on GPS readings, on the iPhone.  It will allow riders to create route segments and to track their speed (at 1-5 second intervals) on that specific segment.  The application will allow the user to graph, as a function of distance along segment, their speed.  Further, the results from different rides will be cached, allowing the user to plot multiple rides on the same graph, allowing the rider to see changes in performance over time.

Caching will be on a server.
